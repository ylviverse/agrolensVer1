🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection App (CNN + Flutter)

This is a **Flutter + Machine Learning mobile app** designed to detect rice leaf diseases using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. It was developed as part of my **Bachelor’s thesis/research project**.

The core of the ML model is based on a **fine-tuned MobileNetV3**, validated using rice leaf image datasets from **Kaggle**. The app architecture uses a **Cupertino-style widget tree** (for iOS-native look and feel), with a `MaterialApp` root to allow best use of both design systems.
